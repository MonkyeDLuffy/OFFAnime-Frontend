/**
 * "Seasonal Anime" — the homepage's final carousel, below "TOP RATED ANIME".
 *
 * Reuses the exact `/api/home` feed the hero and every other row already
 * load: within one render pass Next.js memoizes the identical fetch (same
 * URL and options), and the feed is Data-Cached for 60s (SHORT TTL), so this
 * adds no extra upstream call. The backend documents the home sections
 * independently (`trending`, `popular`, `seasonal`, `topRated`); this row
 * renders the `seasonal` collection only — a distinct section, never
 * substituted with trending, popular or topRated data. Upstream order is
 * preserved exactly as delivered. The cards and the row are the shared
 * PopularCard/PopularRow pair, so the vertical posters, hover info panels,
 * 700ms trailer popups (muted autoplay, glass mute toggle) and carousel
 * navigation are pixel-identical to the other rows. Because this is the last
 * section, its bottom padding (pb-20 sm:pb-24) offsets the shared
 * PopularRow wrapper's pull-up (-mb-8 sm:-mb-12, see PopularRow) so the page
 * ends a comfortable distance below the posters, and the reserved
 * hover-panel space stays fully inside this (overflow-hidden) section, so a
 * panel on the last row is never clipped. The hero owns feed error/empty
 * presentation, so this section renders nothing when the feed failed or
 * seasonal is missing/empty — never padded substitutes; entries with
 * missing posters or trailers degrade gracefully inside the card itself
 * (gradient fallback, no preview).
