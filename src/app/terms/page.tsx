            this is a general draft of the site&apos;s terms, written to be
            understandable rather than exhaustive. It should be reviewed for
            your applicable jurisdiction — ideally by a qualified legal
            professional — before being relied upon in production. Nothing
            here constitutes legal advice, no business registration, address

            <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-white/60">
              OFFAnime is a discovery and viewing interface for anime
              content. It presents information about anime titles (such as
              posters, descriptions and metadata) together with embedded
              playback of video streams served by third-party providers. The
              site does not host, store, or upload any media files itself; it
              surfaces content that originates from external services.

            <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-white/60">
              Video streams, images, and some metadata shown on OFFAnime come
              from third-party services over which we have no control. We
              don&apos;t endorse, warrant, or guarantee any third-party
              content, and we are not responsible for its availability,
              accuracy, legality, or any practices of the providers behind
              it. Where the site links to or embeds external services, those
              services have their own terms and policies — your use of them
              is a matter between you and the provider.

            </h2>
            <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-white/60">
              To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, OFFAnime and
              its operators will not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
              or consequential damages arising from your use of — or
              inability to use — the site, or from any third-party content
              accessed through it. Because the site provides access to
              third-party services it does not control, no warranty is made
              about the accuracy, legality, or safety of that content.
              Nothing in this section limits liability that cannot be limited
              under applicable law.

            <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-white/60">
              We may revise these terms as the service evolves. The version
              published on this page is always the current one, and material
              changes will be reflected here. It&apos;s a good idea to check
              back occasionally — continued use of the site after changes are
              published constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.
